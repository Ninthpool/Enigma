A WIFE OF NOBLE CHARACTER WHO CAN FIND
SHE IS WORTH FAR MORE THAN RUBIES
HER HUSBAND HAS FULL CONFIDENCE IN HER
AND LACKS NOTHING OF VALUE
SHE BRINGS HIM GOOD NOT HARM
ALL THE DAYS OF HER LIFE
SHE SELECTS WOOL AND FLAX AND WORKS WITH EAGER HANDS
SHE IS LIKE THE MERCHANT SHIPS
BRINGING HER FOOD FROM AFAR
